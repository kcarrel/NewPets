# Merge Flow
- When you are working on a new feature Slack the group and update Taiga 
- Make a new branch for the feature to work on
- Once change is ready to review make a pull request with a detailed description of changes and notify Slack members
- 2 group members review (notify others in Slack if you are doing this) and provide comments or approval
- Once comments are addressed and/or majority approval is obtained the creator of the feature merges branch into master and notifies Slack
- Celebrate and reflect on how far you have come
